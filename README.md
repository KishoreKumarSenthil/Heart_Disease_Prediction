# Heart Disease Prediction System using machine learning
>The aim of this project is to predict heart disease using data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms.This project implements 4 classificiation models using scikit-learn: Logistic Regression, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Support Vector Classifier and Decision Tree Model to investigate their performance on heart disease datasets obtained from the UCI data repository.

**Project Objective:**
>The primary objective of this project is to create a robust and accurate predictive model that can identify individuals at risk of liver diseases based on various medical and demographic features. Early detection of liver diseases can significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling timely medical intervention.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Python:** The project utilizes Python as the primary programming language for data preprocessing, analysis, and model development.
- **Libraries:** Key Python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and Seaborn are employed for data manipulation, machine learning, and data visualization.
- **Machine Learning:** Various machine learning algorithms are explored and compared to identify the most suitable model for predicting heart diseases.

**Key Achievements:**
- **Model Accuracy:** Through rigorous experimentation and feature engineering, the project achieved an impressive model accuracy of 91%. This high accuracy underscores the effectiveness of the predictive model in identifying potential heart disease cases.
- **Data Visualization:** The project includes insightful data visualizations using Seaborn, allowing for a better understanding of the dataset and its characteristics.
- **Machine Learning:** Different classification algorithms, such as decision tree classification and logistic regression, were employed to create the predictive model. The final model was selected based on its superior performance.

Early detection of heart diseases is crucial for timely medical intervention, and this project demonstrates how data science and machine learning can contribute to healthcare by providing a valuable tool for identifying individuals at risk. The "Heart Disease Prediction" project exemplifies the practical application of data science skills in solving real-world health challenges.
